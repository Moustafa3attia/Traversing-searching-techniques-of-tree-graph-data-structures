# Traversing and searching techniques of tree and graph data structures
This repo contains algorithms I've implemented by hand 100%. Some using Prolog and some using C (I'll refine and upload them as soon as I get some free time and also I'll announce the dependencies).
Not all algorithms are running well so I'm not sure if you could run it by now.
We were assigned these algorithms during the "Operating Systems" class, 3rd year, CE at Helwan Univ.
These are just for my resume and for educational purposes only !!! NOT for copying by students taking this class.
