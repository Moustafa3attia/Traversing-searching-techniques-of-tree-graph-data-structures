# Traversing-searching-techniques-of-tree-graph-data-structures
This repo contains algorithms I've implemented by hand 100%.
We were assigned these algorithms during the "Operating Systems" class, 3rd year, CE at Helwan Univ.
These are just for my resume and for educational purposes only !!! NOT for copying by students taking this class.
